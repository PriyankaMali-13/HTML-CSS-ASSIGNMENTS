			<p>My Final Year Project</p>
			<p>
				The number of vehicles is increasing day by day whereas the
				parking spaces are still limited. Vehicular population is
				shooting out the roof, no amount of space is sufficient to
				accommodate stationary vehicles. Management of parking has grown
				to large extent. Due to which in metro cities, Parking is a big
				challenging problem. Daily, it is estimated that 30% of vehicles
				in the central area of cities travel around for finding parking
				slots, which takes an average of 7.8 minutes to find parking
				slots. Travelling around on streets for parking does not only
				waste time and fuel for drivers but also contributes to
				additional traffic congestion, gas emissions, and traffic
				accidents. Not only the scarcity of parking area but also the
				lack of well-designed reservation system for parking services is
				another parking problem. Since past few years, on-street and
				garage parking management problems attract attention from
				transportation science, operational management and computer
				science fields.
