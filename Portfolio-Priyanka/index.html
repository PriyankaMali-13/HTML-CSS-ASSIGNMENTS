				"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The
				troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who
				see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have
				no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with
				them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do
				is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human
				race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we
				see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think
				they can change the world, are the ones who do." â€” Apple Inc
